Welcome to my Cousera IBM Data Science Capstone!

Here you will find the .ipynb file that shows the entire code for this project.  I recommend is to click open the .ipynb and copy the link.  Then paste that link to http://nbviewer.org/ in order to see the folium maps.  Github unfortunately does not let folium maps show up in the codes.  

My formal report is also included as the .pdf

I also included images I used in the formal report in the file labeled as 'Images' incase you want to see the tables and foliums maps (dropping the link to the nbviewer.org is the easiest route but this is another option).
