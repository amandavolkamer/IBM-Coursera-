# IBM Data Science Capstone Project

## Project Overview

The Capstone project is the culmination of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program. In this project, I apply a variety of data science techniques to solve real-world problems. For this particular project, I explored datasets related to crime and housing in two major cities: New York and Toronto. Through this project, I demonstrate my proficiency in data cleaning, visualization, machine learning, and data-driven decision-making.

### Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to analyze crime and housing data in both New York and Toronto. By performing various analyses, clustering, and visualizations, we aim to uncover insights into crime patterns and housing affordability. The end result is a series of actionable insights that can be used for improving public safety and housing policies.

## Data Overview

The datasets used in this project are sourced from public datasets for New York and Toronto. The data includes crime statistics, housing prices, and neighborhood details, which have been used to create various visualizations and to perform clustering analyses.

- **New York Crime Data**: Contains details of crimes occurring across New York City.
- **Toronto Crime Data**: Contains details of crimes occurring across Toronto.
- **New York Housing Data**: Information about housing prices and features in New York.
- **Toronto Housing Data**: Information about housing prices and features in Toronto.

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning and Exploration**: The data was cleaned to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and ensure the accuracy of information.
2. **Data Visualization**: Various types of visualizations were created to explore crime and housing trends across both cities.
   - Heatmaps, bar charts, and scatter plots were used to visualize crime data and housing affordability.
3. **Clustering**: K-means clustering was applied to group neighborhoods based on crime and housing features, helping to identify areas with similar characteristics.
4. **Insights & Recommendations**: Based on the clustering results and visualizations, I provide insights into crime hot spots and affordable housing areas.

## Project Files

Hereâ€™s an overview of the files and their contents in this repository:

- **Toronto Housing Dataframe**: A cleaned dataset of housing data for Toronto.

### Final Report
- **Final Capstone Report.pdf**: A detailed report summarizing the project's findings, methodology, and recommendations.

## Key Insights

- **Crime Clusters**: Areas in both cities that exhibit higher crime rates can be identified through clustering, allowing city planners to target interventions.
- **Affordable Housing**: The analysis of housing affordability across neighborhoods offers valuable insights into where affordable housing could be prioritized.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For creating and running the notebooks.
- **Machine Learning**: K-means clustering for neighborhood segmentation.

## Future Work

- **Prediction Models**: Build predictive models to forecast crime rates and housing prices in different neighborhoods.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Enhance geospatial analysis by integrating additional geographic data.
