# Machine Learning – Classification

Build and evaluate classification models using K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression to predict loan approval outcomes.

## 📄 Project Overview

This project was completed as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera.  
The goal was to apply machine learning techniques to build, evaluate, and compare different classification models for predicting loan approval outcomes based on historical loan data.
