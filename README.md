# IBM Data Science Coursera Projects

Welcome to my **IBM Data Science Coursera** repository! This repository contains projects completed as part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** course on Coursera. Here, you will find a variety of data science projects, including data analysis, machine learning, and geographic clustering.

The primary focus of the projects is on analyzing crime and housing data from New York and Toronto, visualizing the data using different charts and maps, and clustering venues to explore potential trends and insights.

## Projects Overview

### Capstone Project
The **Capstone** project is the culmination of my learning. In this project, I used clustering techniques to segment neighborhoods in New York and Toronto and analyze crime and housing data. Here are the key components of the project:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Loading, cleaning, and preparing datasets for analysis.
   - Handling missing data and transforming variables as needed.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Visualizing crime and housing data using bar charts, heat maps, and scatter plots.
   - Using the **Elbow Method** for identifying the optimal number of clusters in the data.

3. **Clustering**:
   - Segmenting the neighborhoods into clusters using K-means clustering.
   - Visualizing clusters using various maps (including venue cluster maps and crime heat maps).
   
### Projects and Files
Here is a list of key files and their descriptions:

#### Notebooks
- **Capstone.ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook for the final capstone project. It includes the steps for data cleaning, analysis, and clustering.
- **Segmenting & Clustering the Toronto Neighborhoods.ipynb**: Analysis of Toronto neighborhoods using clustering techniques.
- - **Data Visualization Topic Survey.ipynb**: Survey-based analysis and data visualization for understanding various data trends. 
- **House_Sales.ipynb**: Data analysis on house sales data, including exploration and visualization.
- **Machine Learning Final Assignment.ipynb**: A machine learning project covering a supervised learning model for predicting house prices.
- **Loading Data and Viewing Data 2.ipynb**: 

#### Visualizations
The visualizations in this repository showcase crime and housing data from New York and Toronto. These images provide insights into crime rates, housing prices, and clustering of venues and neighborhoods.

- **Manhattan Neighborhoods Map.PNG**: Map of neighborhoods in Manhattan.
- **New York Crime Heat Map.PNG**: Heatmap showing crime distribution across New York.
- **Toronto Crime Count.PNG**: A bar chart showing crime count in different Toronto neighborhoods.
- **Toronto Housing Cluster Map.PNG**: Visualization of housing clusters in Toronto.
- **New York Housing Elbow Method.PNG**: Elbow method used for identifying the number of clusters in New York housing data.
- **Venues Cluster Bar Chart.PNG**: A bar chart representing the clusters of venues in New York/Toronto.

#### Additional Files
- **Final Capstone Report.pdf**: The final report of the capstone project, summarizing findings and recommendations.
- **Images Folder**: Contains various PNG images used for visualizations such as neighborhood maps, crime heat maps, and housing cluster maps.

## How to Run the Projects

Each project is contained in its own Jupyter Notebook. To run them locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amandavolkamer/IBM-Coursera.git
   
2. Install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook

## Technologies Used 
The projects in this repository cover various tools and technologies including: 
- Python: Programming language used for data analysis and machine learning.
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- Matplotlib / Seaborn: Data visualization libraries for creating charts and plots.
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning library used for clustering and model building.
- Folium: Python library used for creating interactive maps.

### Additional Notes 
The notebooks are designed for educational purposes and are intended to demonstrate my understanding of key data science concepts learned during the IBM Data Science course.
