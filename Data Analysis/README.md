Examine how changes in GDP (Gross Domestic Product) impact the unemployment rate in the United States.

## 📄 Project Overview

This project was completed as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera.  
The goal was to apply data wrangling, basic data analysis, and visualization techniques to explore relationships between GDP and unemployment.

- **Dataset**: U.S. GDP and Unemployment data
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas

## 🔧 Skills Demonstrated

- Data Wrangling
- Data Filtering
- Data Analysis
- Dashboard Creation

## 📁 Files

- `Analyzing_US_Economic_Data.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis and dashboard creation
- Dataset: Cleaned GDP data (external) and associated unemployment data (external)

## 📚 Tasks Completed
